# NextJS13-TailwindCSS-Turbopack-Template

This is an out the box template I created to help developers get up and running due to conflicting available information online on how to use NextJS 13, Turbopack, & TailwindCSS successfully that has been tested and deployable in multiple production environments on Vercel, Google Cloud, & AWS successfully.

Give the repo a star!
