# NextJS13-TailwindCSS-Turbopack-Template

This is an out the box template I created due to conflicting available information online using NextJS 13, Turbopack, & TailwindCSS successfully that has been tested and deployable in production environments on Vercel, Google Cloud, & AWS successfully.

Give the repo a star!
